# HOOKSCORE
HookScore is a short-form content scoring system that analyzes video hooks and predicts their retention potential. It evaluates structure, emotional triggers, clarity, and pattern interrupts to generate a performance score out of 100.  Built for creators, agencies, and growth operators who want data-backed hooks — not guesswork.
