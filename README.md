HookScore

HookScore is a simple tool that analyzes short-form video hooks and gives them a score out of 100. It helps creators and agencies understand whether their opening line is strong enough to grab attention and keep viewers watching. Instead of relying on guesswork, HookScore breaks the hook down into measurable elements like curiosity, clarity, emotional impact, pattern interrupt, and value promise.

The goal is to make hooks more intentional and performance-driven. By scoring each hook based on defined criteria, users can quickly identify weaknesses and improve them before publishing. Instead of asking, “Does this sound good?”, HookScore asks, “Will this stop the scroll?”

The system is designed to be lightweight and practical. It can be used by content creators, short-form agencies, personal brand managers, or marketing teams who want a structured way to improve retention. It also creates consistency — different team members can evaluate hooks using the same framework.

HookScore can be expanded with AI-based sentiment analysis, comparison between multiple hooks, or even integrated into a dashboard for larger content operations. At its core, it turns creative intuition into something measurable and repeatable.
