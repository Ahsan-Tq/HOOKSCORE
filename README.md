HookScore

A Hook Performance Evaluation Engine for Short-Form Content

🚀 What Is HookScore?

HookScore is a lightweight analytical tool that grades short-form video hooks based on high-retention psychology principles.

Instead of asking “Does this sound good?”
HookScore asks:

Does it trigger curiosity?

Does it create tension?

Does it promise value?

Does it disrupt the scroll?

The system outputs a structured score and feedback.
